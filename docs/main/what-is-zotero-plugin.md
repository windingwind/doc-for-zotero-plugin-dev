# What is Zotero Plugin

Zotero plugins allow users to customize and extend the capabilities of the Zotero reference management tool. These plugins can add new features, improve workflows, or enhance Zotero's user experience.

While Zotero plugins share some structural similarities with browser extensions, developing a plugin for Zotero differs in important ways. Zotero is a desktop application, meaning that its plugins can interact directly with the Zotero database, access local files, and communicate with external software. This makes Zotero plugins highly flexible and powerful, allowing for more advanced customizations compared to browser-based extensions.

For example, many plugins leverage Zotero's platform and APIs to:

- Automate citation formatting
- Integrate Zotero with other research or productivity tools
- Customize Zotero’s interface to fit specific workflows

Don’t worry if some of these features sound unfamiliar. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process step by step, ensuring that even beginners can get up to speed with plugin development.
