# Your First Plugin

In this section, you‚Äôll learn how to develop a simple Zotero plugin using the official example plugin, [Make-It-Red](https://github.com/zotero/make-it-red). By the end, you will have a working plugin that modifies Zotero‚Äôs appearance. This is a simple project that is ideal for beginners who want to get familiar with Zotero plugin development.

## Developing the Plugin

Before starting, ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Git allows you to clone (download) the project, and NodeJS is required to install and build the plugin‚Äôs dependencies.

First, open your terminal and clone the official example plugin repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zotero/make-it-red.git
```

Next, enter the project folder and install the required dependencies (libraries the plugin needs to work):

```bash
cd ./make-it-red
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, build the plugin by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build process will generate the plugin file `build/make-it-red-2.0.xpi`.

> üîó Zotero plugins use the `.xpi` file extension, which contains all the plugin‚Äôs scripts and resources. See [Plugin File Structure](#141-plugin-file-structure) for more details.

## Running the Plugin

### Installing Manually

For plugin developers, it's always recommended to use [Beta Builds](https://www.zotero.org/support/beta_builds).

> üîó When developing plugins, it‚Äôs highly recommended to use a separate profile to protect your main library. Follow [this guide](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/multiple_profiles) to create a new profile.

In the Zotero menu bar, click `Tools` -> `Plugins` to open the _Plugins Manager_ window.

To install the plugin:

1. Click the settings (‚öôÔ∏è) icon in the top-right of the _Plugins Manager_ window.
2. Select `Install Plugin From File...` and choose the `xpi` file you built.
3. Alternatively, drag-and-drop the `xpi` file into the _Plugins Manager_ window.

After the plugin is successfully installed, it will be listed in the _Plugins Manager_. You can verify that the _Make-It-Red_ plugin works by checking the text in the items and library list‚Äîif it turns red, the installation was successful.

### Loading from Source Code

It can be frustrating to manually install the plugin every time you make a change. To streamline development, you can load the plugin directly from the source code, ensuring that the latest version is used whenever Zotero is started.

After creating your plugin's source directory with sample code, you can tell Zotero to load the plugin by creating an extension proxy file. (This is a technique that used to be possible for Firefox extension development, though it's since been discontinued in Firefox.)

1. Close Zotero.
2. Create a text file in the `extensions` directory of your Zotero profile directory named after the extension id (e.g., `myplugin@mydomain.org`). The file contents should be the absolute path to the root of your plugin source code directory, where your `manifest.json` or `bootstrap.js` file is located.
3. Open `prefs.js` in the Zotero profile directory in a text editor and delete the lines containing `extensions.lastAppBuildId` and `extensions.lastAppVersion`. Save the file and restart Zotero. This will force Zotero to read the 'extensions' directory and install your plugin from the source, after which you should see it listed in Tools ‚Üí Add-ons. This is only necessary once.
4. Whenever you make changes to your plugin code, start Zotero from the command line and pass the `-purgecaches` flag to force Zotero to re-read any cached files. (This may no longer be necessary with Zotero 7.) You'll likely want to make an alias or shell script that also includes the `-ZoteroDebugText` and `-jsconsole` flags and perhaps `-p <Profile>`, where `<Profile>` is the name of a development profile.

> Let's _make it blue_, instead of red.
>
> Modify your plugin's code and observe the changes in Zotero.
>
> 1. Open `src/style.css` and change `color: red;` to `color: blue;`.
> 2. Run `npm run build`, then manually reinstall the plugin.
> 3. Restart Zotero and you'll see the items list now displayed in blue.

## Debugging the Plugin

### _Run JavaScript_ Window

You can run JavaScript code directly in Zotero using the _Run JavaScript_ window, which is the easiest way to test code snippets.

To access the window:

1. Go to `Tools` ‚Üí `Developer` ‚Üí `Run JavaScript`.
2. Type your code in the left panel.
3. Click `Run`, and the results will be displayed on the right.

> üí° Try this out!
>
> Select an item in the library, then run `ZoteroPane.getSelectedItems()[0]` in the _Run JavaScript_ window.
> This will return the first selected item in your library.

> üîó For more details about the _Run JavaScript_ window, see [Running Ad Hoc JavaScript in Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/client_coding/javascript_api#running_ad_hoc_javascript_in_zotero).

### Debug Output

Zotero provides a built-in debug output system that helps developers track issues.

To log debug messages, use the `Zotero.debug` function. You can view the debug output by going to `Help` ‚Üí `Debug Output Logging` ‚Üí `View Output`.

> üí° Try this out!
>
> In the _Run JavaScript_ window, run the code `Zotero.debug("Hello, World!")`. Then check the debug output window to see the message.

![alt text](/assets/debug-output.png)

> üîó For more details about using the debug output, see [Debug Output Logging](https://www.zotero.org/support/debug_output#zotero).

Although it's not possible for plugin developers to access users' debug output using the Debug ID, you can ask users to enable debug output, reproduce the issue, and send you the debug output.

### DevTools

Since Zotero is built on Firefox, you can use the Firefox Developer Tools to interact with Zotero‚Äôs interface, inspect the DOM (Document Object Model), set breakpoints in your code, monitor network requests, and much more.

> üîó For a full guide to Firefox‚Äôs developer tools, refer to the [Firefox DevTools User Docs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/).

Zotero beta builds include the Firefox 115 devtools. To start a beta build with the Browser Toolbox open, pass the `-jsdebugger` flag on the command line:

```bash
# the /path/to/zotero is the path to the Zotero executable
# For MacOS:
# /Applications/Zotero.app/Contents/MacOS/zotero
# For Windows:
# C:\Program Files (x86)\Zotero\zotero.exe
/path/to/zotero -ZoteroDebugText -jsdebugger
```

If you‚Äôre running Zotero from source code, use the `-d` flag with the [build_and_run script](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/client_coding/building_the_desktop_app#helper_script "dev:client_coding:building_the_desktop_app"), which will rebuild Zotero with devtools included and launch it with the `-jsdebugger` flag.

> In the Run JS window, run `Zotero.getMainWindow().console.log("Hello, World!")`. Check the devtools' console to see the output.
