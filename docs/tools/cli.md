A command-line tool that helps you with:

- pre-development: setting up your development environment for auto hot-reloading, linting, and building
- development: locale & prefs type definitions generation
- post-development: testing, packaging, publishing, and releasing your plugin with version management and release channel control.

This tool is by default included when you use the [windingwind/zotero-plugin-template](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-plugin-template).
