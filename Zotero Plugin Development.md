# 1 Getting Started

## 1.1 What is Zotero Plugin

Plugins can customize the experience of using Zotero and enhance its capability by adding functions and features to Zotero.

The Zotero plugin has a similar structure of browser's web-extension, while developing a Zotero plugin is quite different from developing a browser extension. As a desktop application, Zotero allows plugins to be very flexible and powerful, like using Zotero database, accessing local files, and communicating with other applications.

## 1.2 Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of web technologies, including [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
- A computer with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) installed.
- And most importantly, a good idea of what you want to build!

## 1.3 Your First Plugin

In this section, we'll guide you through developing your first Zotero plugin. We'll use the official example plugin [Make-It-Red](https://github.com/zotero/make-it-red) as an example.

### 1.3.1 Developing the Plugin

Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed and configured.

First, open the terminal and run the following code to clone the official plugin example repo make-it-red:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zotero/make-it-red.git
```

Download necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd ./make-it-red
npm install
```

Run the following commands to build the plugin:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build results are `build/make-it-red-2.0.xpi`.

> üîó For Zotero plugins, we use `xpi` file extension. It is zipped with all the script files and resources. See [Plugin File Structure](#141-plugin-file-structure) for more details about the XPI file.

### 1.3.2 Running the Plugin

#### 1.3.2.1 Installing Manually

For plugin developers, it's always recommended to use [Beta Builds](https://www.zotero.org/support/beta_builds).

> üîó During the plugin development, it is strongly recommended to use a separate profile. You can follow [this document](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/multiple_profiles) to create a new profile. Be cautious when developing plugins on profile with your important data!

In the menu bar, click `Tools` -> `Plugin` to open the _Plugins Manager_ window.

To install the plugin, from the settings (‚öôÔ∏è) menu in the Plugins Manager, click `Install Plugin From File...` and select the `xpi` file we just built. Alternatively, you can drag-drop the `xpi` file to the _Plugin Manager_ window.

After the plugin is successfully installed and enabled, you can see the text in the items list and the library list are turned to red, as indicated by the example plugin's name _Make-It-Red_.

![Run Plugin Result](run-plugin.png)

#### 1.3.2.2 Loading from Source Code

It could be annoying to manually install the plugin every time you make a change. You can load the plugin from the source code directly. Every time you start Zotero, the plugin will be loaded using the latest code.

After creating your plugin's source directory with sample code, you can tell Zotero to load the plugin by creating an extension proxy file. (This is a technique that used to be possible for Firefox extension development, though it's since been discontinued in Firefox.)

1. Close Zotero.
2. Create a text file in the 'extensions' directory of your Zotero profile directory named after the extension id (e.g., `myplugin@mydomain.org`). The file contents should be the absolute path to the root of your plugin source code directory, where your `manifest.json` or `bootstrap.js` file is located.
3. Open `prefs.js` in the Zotero profile directory in a text editor and delete the lines containing `extensions.lastAppBuildId` and `extensions.lastAppVersion`. Save the file and restart Zotero. This will force Zotero to read the 'extensions' directory and install your plugin from source, after which you should see it listed in Tools ‚Üí Add-ons. This is only necessary once.
4. Whenever you make changes to your plugin code, start up Zotero from the command line and pass the `-purgecaches` flag to force Zotero to re-read any cached files. (This may no longer be necessary with Zotero 7.) You'll likely want to make an alias or shell script that also includes the `-ZoteroDebugText` and `-jsconsole` flags and perhaps `-p <Profile>`, where `<Profile>` is the name of a development profile.

> üí° Try this out!
>
> After setting up the development environment, make a change to the plugin code and see the result in Zotero.
> Let's _make it blue_, instead of red.
>
> 1. Open `src/style.css`, change the `color: red;` in line 2 to `color: blue`.
> 2. Run `npm run build` again, then install the plugin again manually.
> 3. Quit (Ctrl/Cmd + Q) and restart Zotero
> 4. You will see the text in the items list and the library list are turned to blue now.

### 1.3.3 Debugging the Plugin

#### 1.3.3.1 _Run JavaScript_ Window

To run JavaScript in Zotero, the easiest way is using the _Run JavaScript_ window.

In the menu bar, click `Tools` -> `Developer` -> `Run JavaScript`. Type the code in the left panel and click `Run` to execute. The result will be shown on the right panel.

> üí° Try this out!
>
> Select an item in the library, then run `ZoteroPane.getSelectedItems()[0]` in the _Run JavaScript_ window.

![Run JS window](run-js.png)

> üîó For more details about the _Run JavaScript_ window, see [Running Ad Hoc JavaScript in Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/client_coding/javascript_api#running_ad_hoc_javascript_in_zotero).

#### 1.3.3.2 Debug Output

Zotero has a built-in debug output system that are more friendly to users for providing feedback and debugging information.

Plugin developers can use the `Zotero.debug` function to output messages to the debug console. The debug console can be opened by clicking `Help` -> `Debug Output Logging` -> `View Output`.

> üí° Try this out!
>
> Run `Zotero.debug("Hello, World!")` in the _Run JavaScript_ window and check the debug output.

![alt text](debug-output.png)

> üîó For more details about using the debug output, see [Debug Output Logging](https://www.zotero.org/support/debug_output#zotero).

Although it's not possible for plugin developers to access users' debug output using the Debug ID, you can ask users to enable debug output, reproduce the issue, and send you the debug output.

#### 1.3.3.3 DevTools

Since Zotero is based on Firefox, it's possible to use the Firefox Developer Tools to interact with the DOM, set code breakpoints, follow network requests, and more.

> üîó For more details about the devtools, see [Firefox DevTools User Docs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/).

Zotero 7 beta builds include the Firefox 115 devtools. To start a beta build with the Browser Toolbox open, pass the¬†`-jsdebugger`¬†flag on the command line:

```bash
# the /path/to/zotero is the path to the Zotero executable
# For MacOS:
# /Applications/Zotero.app/Contents/MacOS/zotero
# For Windows:
# C:\Program Files (x86)\Zotero\zotero.exe
/path/to/zotero -ZoteroDebugText -jsdebugger
```

When running Zotero from source, passing¬†`-d`¬†flag to the¬†[build_and_run script](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/client_coding/building_the_desktop_app#helper_script "dev:client_coding:building_the_desktop_app")¬†will rebuild (`-r`) with the devtools included and pass¬†`-jsdebugger`.

![DevTools](devtools.png)

> üí° Try this out!
>
> Run `Zotero.getMainWindow().console.log("Hello, World!")` from the Run JS window and check the devtools' console.

### 1.3.4 Conclusion

In section 1.3, we introduced how to develop your first Zotero plugin, run the plugin, and debug the plugin. We also provided some tips for debugging the plugin.

By now, you should have a basic understanding of how to run the example plugin and how to debug it. You might still don't know how to create the features you want, but don't worry, we'll cover that in the following sections.

In section 1.4, we'll introduce the anatomy of a Zotero plugin, so that you can have an overview of the plugin structure and how it works.

## 1.4 Plugin Anatomy

In this section, we'll introduce the structure of a Zotero plugin, including the plugin file structure and the update mechanism.

### 1.4.1 Plugin File Structure

A plugin consists of a collection of files, packaged for distribution and installation. It is similar to a web extension, but with some differences.

#### 1.4.1.1 manifest.json

The `manifest.json` file is the metadata file for the plugin. It contains the plugin's name, version, description, and other information.

This file must be in the root directory of the plugin.

Here is an example of a `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Make It Red",
  "version": "2.0",
  "description": "Makes everything red",
  "homepage_url": "https://github.com/zotero/make-it-red",
  "applications": {
    "zotero": {
      "id": "make-it-red@example.com",
      "update_url": "https://zotero-download.s3.amazonaws.com/tmp/make-it-red/updates-2.0.json",
      "strict_min_version": "6.999",
      "strict_max_version": "7.0.*"
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation of the fields in the `manifest.json` file are as follows. The fields marked with `*` are required.

- `manifest_version`\*: The version of the manifest file format. Currently, the only valid value is 2.
- `name`\*: The name of the plugin.
- `version`\*: The version of the plugin. The version number should follow [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/version) format.
- `description`: A brief description of the plugin. It will be shown in the _Plugin Manager_.
- `homepage_url`: The URL of the plugin's homepage. It will be shown in the _Plugin Manager_.
- `applications/zotero`\*: The application-specific information. It is based on [browser_specific_settings.gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings) and must be present for Zotero to install your plugin.
  - `id`\*: The unique identifier for the plugin. It should be in the format of `myplugin@mydomain.org`.
  - `update_url`: The URL of the update manifest. See also [Plugin Update](#142-plugin-update).
  - `strict_min_version`: The minimum version of Zotero that the plugin is compatible with. You should set it to `x.x.*` of the latest Zotero minor version that you have tested your plugin with.
  - `strict_max_version`: The maximum version of Zotero that the plugin is compatible with.

#### 1.4.1.2 bootstrap.js

The `bootstrap.js` file is the main script file for the plugin. It is executed in the plugin's lifecycle, such as when the plugin is loaded, unloaded, or updated.

A `bootstrap.js` file containing functions to handle various events:

- Plugin lifecycle hooks
- Window hooks

The figure below shows the lifecycle of a plugin and how the hooks are called.

![lifecycle](lifecycle.png)

**Plugin lifecycle hooks**

Plugin lifecycle hooks are modeled after the legacy Mozilla¬†[bootstrapped-extension framework](http://www.devdoc.net/web/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Bootstrapped_Extensions.html#Bootstrap_entry_points "http://www.devdoc.net/web/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Bootstrapped_Extensions.html#Bootstrap_entry_points"):

- `startup()`
- `shutdown()`
- `install()`
- `uninstall()`

Plugin lifecycle hooks are passed two parameters:

- An object with these properties:
  - `id`, a string of the plugin id
  - `version`, a string of the plugin version
  - `rootURI`, a string¬†URL¬†pointing to the plugin's files. For XPIs, this will be a¬†`jar:file:///`¬†URL. This value will always end in a slash, so you can append a relative path to get a¬†URL¬†for a file bundled with your plugin (e.g.,¬†`rootURI + 'style.css'`).
- A number representing the reason for the event, which can be checked against the following constants:¬†`APP_STARTUP`,¬†`APP_SHUTDOWN`,¬†`ADDON_ENABLE`,¬†`ADDON_DISABLE`,¬†`ADDON_INSTALL`,¬†`ADDON_UNINSTALL`,¬†`ADDON_UPGRADE`,¬†`ADDON_DOWNGRADE`

Any initialization unrelated to specific windows should be triggered by¬†`startup`, and removal should be triggered by¬†`shutdown`.

The¬†`install()`¬†and¬†`startup()`¬†bootstrap methods are called only after Zotero has initialized, and the¬†`Zotero`¬†object is automatically made available in the bootstrap scope, along with¬†`Services`,¬†`Cc`,¬†`Ci`, and other Mozilla and browser objects.

Bootstrapped plugins can be disabled or uninstalled without restarting Zotero, so you'll need to make sure you remove all functionality in the¬†`shutdown()`¬†function.

**Window Hooks**

Window hooks, available only in Zotero 7, are called on the opening and closing of the main Zotero window:

- `onMainWindowLoad()`
- `onMainWindowUnload()`

Window hooks are passed one parameter:

- An object with a¬†`window`¬†property containing the target window

Main windows might already be opened when the plugin is loaded, in which case¬†`onMainWindowLoad`¬†will not be called for those windows. You should always check for the existence of any main windows and call it manually if necessary.

```javascript
// In bootstrap.js
async function startup(data, reason) {
  // Do any initialization that should happen when the plugin is loaded

  // After initialization, call onMainWindowLoad for any existing main windows
  await Promise.all(
    Zotero.getMainWindows().map((win) => onMainWindowLoad(win))
  );
}
```

On some platforms, the main window can be opened and closed multiple times during a Zotero session, so any window-related activities, such as modifying the main UI, adding menus, or binding shortcuts must be performed by¬†`onMainWindowLoad`¬†so that new main windows contain your changes.

You must then¬†**remove all references to a window or objects within it, cancel any timers, etc.**, when¬†`onMainWindowUnload`¬†is called, or else you'll risk creating a memory leak every time the window is closed. DOM elements added to a window will be automatically destroyed when the window is closed, so you only need to remove those in¬†`shutdown()`, which you can do by cycling through all windows:

```javascript
function shutdown() {
  var windows = Zotero.getMainWindows();
  for (let win of windows) {
    win.document.getElementById("make-it-red-stylesheet")?.remove();
  }
}
```

> Currently, only one main window is supported, but some users may find ways to open multiple main windows, and this will be officially supported in a future version.

Some plugins may require additional hooks in Zotero itself to work well as bootstrapped plugins. If you're having trouble accomplishing something you were doing previously via XUL overlays, let us know on¬†[zotero-dev](https://groups.google.com/g/zotero-dev "https://groups.google.com/g/zotero-dev").

#### 1.4.1.3 Locale

Mozilla has introduced a new localization system called¬†[Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/ "https://projectfluent.org/"), which replaces both `.dtd` and `.properties` localization. While both `.dtd` and `.properties` are still supported in the current version of Zotero 7, `.dtd` files and `.properties` files will be remove in the future. To ensure future compatibility, plugin should aim to use Fluent for localization going forward.

See the¬†[Fluent Syntax Guide](https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/ "https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/")¬†for more information on creating Fluent files.

**Registering Fluent Files**

To use Fluent in your plugin, create a¬†`locale`¬†folder in your plugin root with subfolders for each locale, and place `.ftl` files within each locale folder:

```
locale/en-US/make-it-red.ftl
locale/fr-FR/make-it-red.ftl
locale/zh-CN/make-it-red.ftl
```

Any `.ftl` files you place in the locale subfolders will be automatically registered in Zotero's localization system.

**Using a Fluent File in a Document**

Fluent files you include with your plugin can be applied to a document with a¬†`<link>`¬†element.

For example, a Fluent file located at

```
[plugin root]/locale/en-US/make-it-red.ftl
```

could be included in an XHTML file as

```html
<link rel="localization" href="make-it-red.ftl" />
```

If the document's default namespace is XUL, include¬†HTML¬†as an alternative namespace (`xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"`) and prefix the link:

```html
<html:link rel="localization" href="make-it-red.ftl" />
```

If modifying an existing window, you can create a¬†`<link>`¬†element dynamically:

```javascript
MozXULElement.insertFTLIfNeeded("make-it-red.ftl");
```

(`MozXULElement`¬†will be a property of the window you're modifying.)

Please ensure that you have inserted the FTL into the window before making any changes to the DOM.

If adding to an existing window, be sure to remove the¬†`<link>`¬†in your plugin's¬†`shutdown`¬†function:

```javascript
doc.querySelector('[href="make-it-red.ftl"]').remove();
```

### 1.4.2 Plugin Update

The update manifests are set up to demonstrate upgrading across all versions, but normally a plugin would point to a single update manifest that was updated as new versions were available. The update manifests for versions 1.1 and 1.2 are set up to allow upgrading directly to 2.0 from Zotero 7.

## 1.5 Conclusion

For most developers, the initial motivation to develop a plugin is to solve a problem they have encountered, or to satisfy a need they have. Very possibly, someone else has the similar problem or need, and your plugin could be useful to them. We encourage you to share your plugin with the community.
